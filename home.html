                <p class="card-text">Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically
                   through experience and by the use of data.[1] It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence.
                    Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data",
                     in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.[2] 
                     Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and 
                     computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the 
                     needed tasks...</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Artificial intelligence </h5>
                <p class="card-text">Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines,
                   unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals, 
                   which involves consciousness and emotionality. The distinction between the former
                    and the latter categories is often revealed by the acronym chosen. 
                    'Strong' AI is usually labelled as AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) while attempts 
                    to emulate 'natural' intelligence have been called ABI (Artificial Biological Intelligence). 
                    It has wide range of projects that can be implemeted and can be used in various purposes..

              <p> Robotics develops machines that can substitute for humans and replicate human actions.
                 Robots can be used in many situations and for many purposes, 
                 but today many are used in dangerous environments
                  (including inspection of radioactive materials, bomb detection and deactivation), manufacturing processes,
                   or where humans cannot survive (e.g. in space, underwater, in high heat, and clean up and containment of hazardous 
                   materials and radiation). Robots can take on any form but some are made to resemble humans in appearance.
